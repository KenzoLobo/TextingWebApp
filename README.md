# TextingWebApp
A Webb Application that supports messaging over the internet hosted on the ICS32 Winter 2021 class server, complete with a graphical interface. 

HOW TO RUN APPLICATION:

Step 1: Install python
You can do so by clicking on this link and following the instructions https://www.python.org/downloads/
There should be an installer file, click on that to begin installing and IDLE- the default and Development Environment (where you can write and run code) should also get installed.
Step 2: Download all the files
Download the files from the drive and make sure they’re in the same directory (a directory is just a folder) on your computer.
Step 3: Store them Safely
Download the files from the drive and make sure they’re in the same directory (a directory is just a folder) on your computer.
Step 3: Open GUI.py
GUI is a graphical user interface. Once you click on GUI it should open up the messaging platform!
Step 4: Make a new file
Mac users- You should see ‘File’ right at the the top of your screen
Click File → new→ enter a filename
(not important what it is, but every time you use the app you’ll have to open this)
Windows/Linux- There should be a menu bar at the top of the window that just popped up.
Click File → new→ enter a filename
(not important what it is, but every time you use the app you’ll have to open this) Now we can begin texting!
